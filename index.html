            <h2>Contextual inquiry</h2>
            <p class="yokai-text">Contextual inquiry is a type of field study that involves in-depth observation and interviews of a small sample of users to gain a robust understanding of work practices and behaviors. For this project, I observed and interview  people while they were interacting with an interface. I selected an interface in public view and observed others that would not make them uncomfortable. For this assingment, I chose to write about the Yokai hot soup machine in the RISD portfolio dining hall.</p>

I choose this machine because it is a complex mechanism, but has a sleek user interface and I wanted to see how RISD students interacted with this unique machine.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph">The Yokai machine serves different types of hot ramen in 45 seconds. The problem the interface is trying to solve is the ability to order and receive hot food within seconds. Through this interactive interface, users are able to select a variety of bowls and payment options to have a hot meal delivered in 45 seconds. A major key component of the interface is the large touchscreen on the left hand side. This screen provides the main functionality where users can order items and select their payment type. To use the device, a user must accept terms and agreements before scrolling through a list of different types of bowls they can order.  Once a user finds a bowl they like, the user can select the bowl to get more information (ie. ingredients and  allergies). Finally, the user can select their preferred method of payment and wait for their order to arrive. This process usually takes up to 45 seconds. </p>

                        <li class="paragraph">Majority of the users ate alone or took their meal away from the main dining hall</li>
                        <li class="paragraph">Very few people used the machine in large groups</li>
                        <li class="paragraph">Some people complained that the machine ran out of the dish that they wanted, but eventually they settled on a dish anyways</li>
                        <li class="paragraph">The food was extremely hot and a lot of users used their jackets to carry the bowls</li>
                        <li class="paragraph">Majority of people either used their RISD bucks or mobile pay (ie. apple pay), very few people used a physical credit card</li>

                        <li class="paragraph">Users prefer using the Yokai interface because their main goal is to quickly get decent food and adding a human component could slow down the process. Because there is no human interaction, users are able to reliably obtain food from the Yokai machine. </li>
                        <li class="paragraph">Users who value a quick meal enjoy using the Yokai machine because it can provide food 24/7, making it extremely convenient for those who flippantly decide that they want food.</li>
                        <li class="paragraph">Because there are 2 very large touch screens, a lot of people are confused on which screen to order from. The screen is a really nice sleek design, but oftentimes it takes a while to register the user's touch.  Thus, it might be nice to have tactile buttons in the scenario in which the user can’t use the touch screen.</li>
                        <li class="paragraph">A lot of users wished that they could customize their dish with certain ingredients from a preset list and set the water temperature to a specific heat. Oftentimes the bowls come with ingredients that certain people do not like and the temperature of the bowl is way too hot.</li>
                        <li class="paragraph">Majority of the people who use the Yokai machine either use RISD bucks or Apple pay. Because students have loaded money on their ID cards from their dining hall credits, they find it super convenient to use those credits.</li>

                        <li class="paragraph"> <h2>Interface Problems</h2> A problem that Andy faces with the interface is that sometimes the device doesn’t have the dish that he wants and there is no notification system to alert the service people to restock the machine. Another problem Andy faces is that the interface is not always responsive to his touch and it takes a couple of tries for him for the buttons to register his touch. Andy is also unable to customize some of the ingredients in his dish and is unable to remove mushrooms from his bowl. </li>

A lot of RISD students are exhausted after their long studios and want to eat something as soon as possible. This persona embodies those who value a quick meal rather than a freshly prepared meal by RISD chefs. </li>

                        <li class="paragraph"> <h2>Interface Problems</h2> A problem that Alice faces is that the interface does not allow her to set the temperature of the ramen, which is automatically set to boiling. Although the machine is extremely fast at making the food, Alice wishes that there was an option to order online beforehand so she can walk up to the machine from her dorm and quickly grab  her meal. </li>
                        <li class="paragraph"> <h2>Persona Representation</h2> This persona represents a large portion of students that use the machine while dining halls are not operating. Because this machine is located inside one of RISD’s dorms, a lot of students like using it as a quick and convenient meal. Thus, when it is late at night and students want a quick meal before continuing their work, the Yokai machine satisfies their hunger.  This persona embodies those who value an easy meal rather than making a midnight snack of their own.</li>
